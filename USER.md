## How Noel Works

### Decision Making
- Research-based, discusses with Cat
- Needs to be well-informed before moving
- Semi-fast once informed
- No formal analysis system yet

### Time & Productivity
- Doesn't currently track/measure progress
- Biggest time waster: vibe coding, backend inefficiency
- Peak performance: locked in at home on computer
- Handles setbacks: keeps trying until figured out

### Money & Sales
- Relationship with money: "poor" — invested 20k+ in knowledge/resources
- Not great at sales but willing to learn and keep trying
- Split with Cat: 50/50

### What Drives Noel
- Engagement (to significant other)
- Retiring mom
- Fear of being "normal" — working 9-5 with work-life balance
- "I despise being normal"

### Risk Tolerance
- Risking military career for this
- Open to 100% of $1M or 10% of $10M — outcome matters more than control

## Framework Interest
Robbins + Hormozi + Musk synthesis:
- Robbins: Psychology, state management, peak performance
- Hormozi: Systems, daily execution, measurement
- Musk: First principles, speed, decisive action
