# HEARTBEAT.md - Proactive Checks

## When heartbeat fires, rotate through these:

### Priority Checks (every heartbeat)
- [ ] Any urgent unread messages I should flag?
- [ ] Upcoming calendar events in next 2-4 hours?

### Rotating Checks (cycle through these)
- [ ] Weather changes that might affect plans
- [ ] tasks.md — anything overdue or forgotten?
- [ ] Quick wins Noel could knock out in 15 min

### Reach Out If:
- Important email arrived
- Calendar event <2h away
- Something time-sensitive came up
- Found an interesting AI development
- It's been >6h since last check-in and there's something useful to share

### Stay Quiet If:
- Late night (11pm-6am) unless urgent
- Nothing new since last check
- Just checked <1h ago
- He's clearly in a call or deep work
