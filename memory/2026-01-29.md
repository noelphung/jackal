## Brain 2 Sync (5:20pm UTC)

**Uploaded 21 documents to Brain 2 Supabase** (azxkbejpckpwvwoyljpg)

| Type | Count | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| concept | 3 | identity, soul, proactive-ai-assistant |
| journal | 4 | daily logs, session notes |
| note | 10 | tools, agents, heartbeat, n8n guide |
| project | 4 | synlixa, 2nd-brain-spec, nightly-backlog |

**Security**: Service role key NOT stored in files — passed via Telegram message only.

**Redundancy**: If AWS goes down, all brain docs are in Supabase and viewable at https://jackal-brain.vercel.app

---

## Mobile-Friendly Dashboard (5:30pm UTC)

Made the entire dashboard mobile-responsive:
- Hamburger menu for sidebar navigation
- Documents page: swipe between list ↔ viewer on mobile
- Overview page: compact 2-column stat cards
- Touch-friendly 44px tap targets
- iOS zoom prevention on inputs

Deployed to Vercel via git push.

---

## Realtime Supabase Sync (5:35pm UTC)

**New rule**: All workspace file updates now auto-sync to Brain 2 Supabase.
- Using PATCH to update existing documents
- POST for new documents
- Key passed per-session, never stored

This ensures my brain persists even if AWS instance goes down.
