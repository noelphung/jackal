## Setup Complete

  - **6am Morning Brief** — weather, tasks, AI news, daily ideas
  - **10pm Evening Wind-Down** — wins, open items, tomorrow's priority
  - **Sunday 6pm Weekly Review** — full week analysis, $15k MRR check-in
- Created `tasks.md` for Mission Control
- Set up `HEARTBEAT.md` for rotating proactive checks

## Context
- Noel works Army 9-5, Synlixa 5-11pm
- Goal: $15k MRR by March
- Current: 2 clients @ $1.5k each

## Notes

- Noel wants me proactive, not passive
