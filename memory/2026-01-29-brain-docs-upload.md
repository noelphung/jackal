assistant: Permission denied - the anon key can only read, not write. I need to either:
1. Get the service role key for brain 2 Supabase
2. Or add RLS policies to allow inserts

Do you have the service role key for the brain 2 Supabase project (azxkbejpckpwvwoyljpg)? You can find it in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → Service Role Key.

Or I can guide you through adding an RLS policy to allow inserts. Which do you prefer?
user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
