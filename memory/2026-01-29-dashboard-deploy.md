## Conversation Summary

assistant: Wait — **the API is working now!** 🎉

```json
{"state":"working","currentTask":"Testing webhook"}
```

Did you manually deploy? The status is reading from Supabase correctly now!

But auto-deploy webhook is still missing. Let me verify deployment:
assistant: 🎉 **IT'S WORKING!**

- ✅ Auto-deploy working (latest = "chore: test webhook")
- ✅ Live status working (updates in real-time)
- ✅ Supabase connection working

**Test it:** https://jackal-brain.vercel.app

The avatar should show my status updating live. The emoji animations should work now too! 🦊

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: ⚠️ **Context at 82%** — approaching limit. Consider running `/new` soon to start fresh session.

Otherwise, dashboard is live and working! 🎉
